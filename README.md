## Overview
This project aims to detect and segment brain tumors in MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a classification model detects the presence of tumors, and then a segmentation model outlines the tumor regions in positive cases.

## Key Features
- Automated brain tumor detection in MRI scans
- Precise tumor segmentation for positive cases
- Custom data generator for efficient processing of medical imaging data
- Implementation of specialized loss functions for handling imbalanced datasets
- Integration of classification and segmentation models for comprehensive analysis

## Technical Details
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV, scikit-image
- **Data Manipulation**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Data Preparation
- The project uses a custom `DataGenerator` class to efficiently load and preprocess MRI images.
- Images are resized to 256x256 pixels and normalized.
- Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training set.

## Model Architecture
1. **Classification Model**: ResNet-50
   - Pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for tumor detection
   - Output: Binary classification (tumor present / not present)

2. **Segmentation Model**: ResUNet
   - Custom architecture combining residual blocks with U-Net structure
   - Output: Pixel-wise segmentation mask

## Training
- The models are trained using a two-stage approach:
  1. The classification model is trained to detect the presence of tumors.
  2. The segmentation model is trained on positive cases to outline tumor regions.
- Custom loss functions (Tversky and Focal Tversky) are implemented to handle class imbalance in segmentation tasks.

## Evaluation
- Classification performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Segmentation performance is assessed using Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU).
- A comprehensive evaluation pipeline combines both models to provide end-to-end tumor detection and segmentation.

## Results
[Include a summary of your model's performance, possibly with some visualizations or metrics]

## Future Improvements
- Implement 3D convolutions to better utilize volumetric MRI data
- Explore ensemble methods for improved classification accuracy
- Investigate attention mechanisms for enhanced segmentation performance
- Develop a user-friendly web interface for easy model deployment
